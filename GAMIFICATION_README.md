## 🎯 How the Agent Responds with Games

The agent now creates **structured learning experiences** rather than just answering questions:

### Course Generation
```typescript
// Example course structure the agent works with
{
  title: "Introduction to Photosynthesis",
  lessons: [
    {
      title: "What is Photosynthesis?",
      questions: ["What do plants need to make food?", "Where does photosynthesis happen?"],
      objectives: ["Understand basic photosynthesis", "Identify key components"]
    }
  ],
  achievements: ["First Steps", "Plant Expert"],
  rewards: { xp: 200, badge: "🌱" }
}
```
